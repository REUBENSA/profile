People communicate with WhatsApp chatbot via the chat interface, like talking to a real person. It's a set of automated replies that simulates a human conversation on WhatsApp Object detection using machine learning Object detection is a computer vision technique for locating instances of objects in images or videos. Object detection algorithms typically leverage machine learning or deep learning to produce meaningful results. When humans look at images or video, we can recognize and locate objects of interest within a matter of moments. The goal of object detection is to replicate this intelligence using a computer Diabetics prediction using machine learning The aim of this project is to develop a system which can perform early prediction of diabetes for a patient with a higher accuracy by combining the results of different machine learning techniques. Fire alarm using microcontrollers in Proteus Our aim is to design such project that sense fire. When there will be firing, motor will turn ON and water is start otherwise motor will be turn OFF. In places where such systems were installed it was seldom observed that they posed more problems than solutions. For example, many times the sprinklers went off because of the smoke caused by some harmless reason thereby creating a lot of mess and nuisance even when there was no fire. Thus a problem of false alarm was there. Not only this, in places like offices, museums, etc. sometimes when a small fire broke out, the damage caused by the water sprinklers, by spoiling the important paperwork, electronic items or pieces of art and history, was more than what the fire could have caused.","title":"Projects"},{"location":"Projects/#fuel-dispensing-system-using-rfid","text":"In this proposed work, RFID system is a microcontroller-based system that reduces the man power and dispenses the accurate amount of fuel.
